# Synthetic Fraud Data Using CTGAN

This repository provides tools and code to generate synthetic fraud datasets using the CTGAN (Conditional Generative Adversarial Network) model. Synthetic data is useful for testing fraud detection systems without exposing sensitive real data.

## Features
- Generate synthetic tabular data similar to real-world fraud datasets
- Use CTGAN for high-fidelity data synthesis
- Example code for data preprocessing, training, and generation

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayushsri/Synthetic-Fraud-Data-Using-CTGAN.git
cd Synthetic-Fraud-Data-Using-CTGAN
